# OSX Initial Setup

Inspired by [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/codeinthehole/26b37efa67041e1307db).

Configure brew packages & casks by your needs.

```
sh bootstrap.sh
```

## Oh My Zsh

My personal favorite zsh configuration.

```
sh ohmyzsh.sh
```

Installs it & add neet aliases which helps a lot daily.
